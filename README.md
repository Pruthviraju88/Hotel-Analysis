# Hotel_Analysis
Project About hotel bookings from past 3 years (2018, 2019, 2020) and analysis of their revenue of hotels

 ---> Here I developed a data analysis project using hotel booking data I sourced from a database I created by uploading Excel data sheets. The database was connected to Power BI to answer some business questions and have a visual product at the end.

# Stakeholder's questions that need to be answered:


" Is our hotel revenue growing over the years? "
We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.
" Should we increase our parking lot size? "
We have to understand if there is a trend for guests with personal cars.
" What trends can we see in the data? "
Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.

# Project Pipeline
